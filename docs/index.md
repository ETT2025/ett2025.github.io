Following on from the success of the 2021 workshop series, _Emerging Topics in Typology_ (ETT), a conference organized by and for PhD students in diversity linguistics, returns for a second edition in the form of a 3-day conference from **June 10th to 12th, 2024**. The conference will be hosted at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/institutionen-for-lingvistik/) in a full hybrid mode. 

We welcome abstracts on a range of topics in diversity linguistics (quantitative and qualitative typology, language documentation and description).
A call for abstracts (open to all current PhD students) will be published in early December.

ETT 2024 is organized in collaboration with [the Department of Linguistics at Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/institutionen-for-lingvistik/), with funding provided by [Stockholm University's Doctoral School in the Humanities](https://www.su.se/doctoral-school-in-the-humanities/).
