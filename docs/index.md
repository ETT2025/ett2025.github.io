The conference will be hosted by [the Department of Linguistics at Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/institutionen-for-lingvistik/) in a fully hybrid mode. 

Submission of abstracts will be open to all current PhD students. We welcome abstracts on a range of topics in diversity linguistics (quantitative and qualitative typology, language documentation and description).
A call for abstracts will be published in early December.
